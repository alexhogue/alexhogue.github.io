                    <p>In <a href="https://dashes.com/2012/12/13/the-web-we-lost/">The Web We Lost</a> (2012), Anil 
                        Dash writes: "In the early days of the social web, there was a
                        broad expectation that regular people might own their own identities by having their own
                        websites, instead of being dependent on a few big sites to host their online identity."</p>
                    <p>In February 2015 the online journal QUARTZ published an article with the provocative
                        headline: <a href="https://qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-using-the-internet">
                        Millions of Facebook users have no idea theyâ€™re using the internet</a>. As the article
                        states: "This is more than a matter of semantics. The expectations and behaviors of the next
                        billion people to come online will have profound effects on how the internet evolves."</p>
                    <p>In October 2014 the online journal GIZMODO published an article heralding <a 
                        href="https://gizmodo.com/the-great-web-1-0-revival-1651487835">The Great Web 1.0
                        Revival</a>. Its author Kyle Chayka observed: <br/>
                        The booming size of today's mainstream social networks and the constant level of noise we
                        have to deal with has inspired a sudden return to a time when the internet was quieter, safer,
                        and more intimate... We're nostalgic for the close-knit, DIY nature of the early web, where
                        everything was smaller... <br/>
                        The DIY aesthetics and practices of the mid-1990s have been embraced by the anti-social
                        network <a href="https://tilde.club/">TILDE.CLUB</a>, which hosts a small community of users 
                        on a single unix computer. For some, TILDE.CLUB serves as a platform for revisiting amateur web 
                        aesthetics in a contemporary context. For example, on her page, Olia Lialina invites users to view 
                        a new net art work <a href="https://tilde.club/~olialia/">640x480</a> - a 4-tab browser installation. For many others however, TILDE.CLUB 
                        has served as little more than a hip territory to occupy. Many pages remain blank.</p>

                    <p>In other corners of the internet, Web 1.0 aesthetics have never disappeared. <a 
                        href="https://luckysoap.com/">My own website</a>, including this page, which uses fixed-width 
                        table cells, is based on a template I created in HomeSite in 1997.</p>
                    <p>Web 1.0 aesthetics persist in source code and stated objectives of the massive <a href=
                        "https://www.ubuweb.com/">Ubu Web site</a>,
                        an "independent resource dedicated to all strains of the avant-garde, ethnopoetics, and outsider
                        arts." On 16 December 2014, the founder of <a href="https://x.com/ubuweb/status/545074372093165568">
                        boasted on Twitter</a> that "the whole damn site is still hand-coded in html 1.0 in bbedit, from 
                        templates made in 1996."</p>
                    <p>I shall put off updating my website templates until out-of-date design is no longer cool.</p>
