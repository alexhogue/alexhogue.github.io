                    <p><strong>I evoke the term 'handmade web' to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by
                        software; web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or
                        corporations; web pages which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages
                        which challenge conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or
                        identity.</strong></p>

                    <p>Handmade web pages flourished in the mid-to-late-1990s, in the brief period after the academic
                        web and before the corporate web. ‘Handmade’ is by no means the only or best term to define
                        the web of this period.</p>
                    <p>In her essay, <a href="https://art.teleportacia.org/observation/vernacular/">A Vernacular Web</a>
                        (2005), Olia Lialina describes the web of the mid-1990s as:
                        bright, rich, personal, slow and under construction. It was a web of sudden connections and
                        personal links. Pages were built on the edge of tomorrow, full of hope for a faster connection
                        and a more powerful computer... it was a web of amateurs soon to be washed away by dot.com
                        ambitions, professional authoring tools and guidelines designed by usability experts. <br/>
                        For more information on Olia Lialina and Dragan Espenschied's excellent research on the
