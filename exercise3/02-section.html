                    <p><strong>I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to make a correlation between handmade web
                        pages and handmade print materials, such as zines, pamphlets, and artists books.</strong></p>

                    <p>I made my first web-based work in 1995. The impetus for <a href=
                        "https://luckysoap.com/butterflies/parasite.html">Fishes & Flying Things</a> came from the
                        material practices of fine art and book-making. The text evolved from an installation art
                        exhibition I had on at the time. From this text, I created a small book-work which was meant to
                        tell a circular story but when people got to the end they stopped reading because that’s the way
                        books work. In the web version, the last page linked to the first; the story circled round and
                        round. Of the installation, no physical evidence remains. Of the book-work, only one copy. The
                        QuarkExpress file is stored on a 44 MB SyQuest cartridge which I still own, but the contents of
                        which I can no longer access. The handmade website, on the other hand, is still online and it still
                        works.</p>
                    <p>The handmade web emerged at a time when print and digital enjoyed a more symbiotic
                        relationship. This is evident in the early output of the 
                        <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/index.asp">trAce Online Writing Centre</a> founded at
                        Nottingham Trent University in 1995. Over the next decade trAce evolved into one of the most
                        influential online writing communities in the world. trAce’s first output was a 
                        <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/writersforthefuture/1995/">word-processed
                        photocopied booklet</a> which contained links to websites distributing journals and zines. Fittingly,
                        trAce’s last output was also a print booklet, in which it is stated: <br/>
                        The trAce community embraced both camps, and some early chatlogs contain lively discussions
                        about the use of mixed media in writing... The creative hypertexts and hypermedia in the trAce
                        Archive can easily be compared to the multifarious pages of an artist’s book. (PDF <a 
                        href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/traces/traces.pdf">trAces: A

                        One of the many interesting things about the <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/index.asp">
                        online archive</a> of the trAce Online Writing Centre is
                        how much it reflects the context of the creation and dissemination of its contents. Whereas
                        archives held in museums or libraries generally contain artifacts created elsewhere —
                        manuscripts illuminated in a monastery, for example, or photographs developed in a darkroom
                        — the handmade web pages contained in this online archive continue to exist in the medium
                        within which they were created. That said, the frames through which we view them continue to
                        change.</p>
                    <p>In "Media Archaeology: Method and Machine versus History and Narrative of Media" (2011)
                        Wolfgang Ernst observes: "If a radio from a museum collection is reactivated to play broadcast
                        channels of the present, it changes its status: it is not a historical object anymore but actively
                        generates sensual and informational presence." Similarly, when viewing old web pages in 
                        modern browsers we are confronted with a temporal paradox. Layer upon layer of 
                        <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/cyberfest/index.htm">dated web-
                        design aesthetics</a> overlap and peel like wallpaper, revealing earlier versions beneath. Pages
                        optimised for lower resolutions now take <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/frame5/">less than 
                        a third of the screen</a>. Ghosts of browsers past
                        mingle with occasional page errors, dead links, and missing images. Sound files play
                        automatically. Warnings abound, issued from earlier eras, addressed to readers who are not us.</p>
                    <p>For example, M.D. Coverley’s <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/frame5/coverley/index.html">
                        The Personalization of Complexity</a> (2001) "explores the ways in
                        which each of our personal computers have become idiosyncratic, individualized entities, only
                        sometimes manageable by the owners." Fittingly, the piece itself warns that it is viewable only
                        on Level 4 and 5 Microsoft Internet Explorer and Level 4 Netscape. Netscape 6 will not support
                        many of the features in this essay.</p>
                    <p>These are not artifacts of a dead web but rather, signposts on a map of a living web pointing to a
                        web as it once was, a web in progress, a web in the making.</p>
